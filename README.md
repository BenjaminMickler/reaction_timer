# Reaction Timer
Welcome to Reaction Timer.
Reaction Timer measures how fast you can react and press the Enter key.
To begin with, you will be asked how many rounds you want to play.
During each round, the program will count down with Ready, Set, GO.
In between Ready and Set the program will wait 1 second, but in between Set and GO, the computer will wait anywhere from 0.5 to 10 seconds (randomly chosen).
When Reaction Timer prints "GO", press enter as quickly as you can.
You will repeat this for each round before being shown your fastest, slowest and average reaction time at the end.
